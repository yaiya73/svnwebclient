# About WebClient for SVN #
WebClient for SVN is a web interface for your Subversion (SVN) repository. The same client delivered in Polarion's ALM solutions, WebClient for SVN offers a convenient way of browsing repository content and history, and also enables basic write operations such as creating folders and uploading files. WebClient for SVN can connect to any subversion repository which provides HTTP access (Subversion 1.1 and higher is supported). Implemented in JSP/Java, this is a platform-independent pure Java solution.
